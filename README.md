# Providing Bugetary Analysis with Cleaner Data

## Overview of Project

Due to the discovery and subsiquent dismissal of Thomas High School's 9th grade scores, we need to do a more detailed analysis of the standardized test scores and how they stack up against the altered scores that we originally presented. In this analysis, we will take a deeper look at how the omitted 461 scores affect our school performance.

## Overview of the Altered Results

We will display the results of the old analysis (left) alongside the results of the new analysis (right). The updated breakdown of our results is as follows:

* *District Summary*
![Summary](Analysis/district_summary.PNG)

Averages and percentages went down between 1 and 3 thenths of a point except for the average reading score which stayed even.

* *School Summary*
![Summary](Analysis/school_summary.PNG)

Thomas High School's average math and reading scores went down by .06% and up by .05% respectively. The percentage of students that passed the test also went down. The percentage that passed the math test was .09% less, the percetage that passed the reading was .29% less, and the percentage that passed both was .31% less.

* *Thomas High's Performance*
![Summary](Analysis/top_5.PNG)

Thomas High School did not change position in the top schools of the district. They retained their top 2 ranking among overall passing students despite the .31% dip.

* *Corrected Data*

Considering we had to replace the data from the ninth graders of Thomas High School, we did not see any of our original metrics change.

The main reason for this is the 9th grade class only account for 461 scores, the majority of which were within the average already seen from the previous analysis. We are aslo grouping everyone in for these scores and 461 becomes less significant on the data as we expand our grouping.

## Results

Thomas High Schools still remains one of the top performing schools in the district despite the couple tenths of a percentage drop the school suffered from omitting the altered grades. While we did see a drop of average math and reading scores, the school still boasts the 6th best math scores and 5th best reading scores. The school also meets all the metrics set by schools of their type, meaning they meet at least the averages of all charter schools in the district. Where the school really shines are the averages per capata. They are performing way above the average per capata in score, but in students that passed, we see values from 13 to almost 30% higher than other schools that spend the same amount per student. Thomas High School does not need any changes to their budget for this coming fiscal year.
