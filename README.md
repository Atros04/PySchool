# Providing Bugetary Analysis with Cleaner Data

## Overview of Project

Due to the discovery and subsiquent dismissal of Thomas High School's 9th grade scores, we need to do a more detailed analysis of the standardized test scores and how they stack up against the altered scores that we originally presented. In this analysis, we will take a deeper look at how the omitted 461 scores affect our school performance.

## Overview of the Altered Results

We will display the results of the old analysis (left) alongside the results of the new analysis (right). The updated breakdown of our results is as follows:

## Results

*- What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code?*

Code refactoring allows for better efficiency across the entire execution of the code. You can find ways to better compress executions and loops, especially as you can grow loops exponentially. However, this efficiency can sometimes lead to inefficiencies especially if you are attempting to refactor legacy code or code written by someone else. A lot of times, we find in the coding world that if something works you usually leave it alone. Though that's bad practice in situations where you just coded something (like this analysis of the stocks), leaving legacy code alone might be better for manhours and your own sanity.

*- How do these advantages and disadvantages apply to the refactor of the stock analysis script?*
Since I had just written the code and was only refactoring some of the calculations, this refactoring was much better for efficiency. We were able to generate the requested data upwards of 700% faster. While 700% sounds like a lot of efficiency, we are talking about 60 to 70 milliseconds saved over the previous script. For the time it took to refactor, we could have written other scripts or spent more time into formatting. This refactoring does, however, assume that the raw data will vastly increase to the point where the refactoring would have been necessary.
